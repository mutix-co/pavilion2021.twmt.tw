  <p>As governments all over the world formulate policies on the use of electric vehicles in an effort to go green, global automakers have been launching a variety of electric vehicles. In fact, electric vehicle market growth has not slowed down, but even accelerated during the pandemic. Electric vehicles have become a sought-after market by traditional automakers, technology giants, and startups, driving the global market in the post-pandemic era. According to TrendForce, an international market intelligence firm, the global automotive market shrank by 13.8% in 2020. In stark contrast, the global electric vehicle market grew by 20% in the same year and is expected to surge by up to 40% in 2021. The market boom is not only reflected in statistics but also in recent investments by automotive suppliers. This forum is set to center around the topic of “The Developing Trend of Taiwanese Robots and Electric Vehicle Technology.” Professionals from leading Taiwanese robot companies are invited to discuss and share their insights into electric vehicle technology, manufacturing, and future trends to provide a comprehensive and accessible overview of electric vehicle technology.</p>
